# The Web Heroines

On June 14, 2022, a few awesome ladies chose their name for the [Web Development course](https://itschool.ro/cursuri/curs-web-development-online) they were starting. After a vote, they decided to call themselves "Web Heroines".

The course is organized by [ITSchool Romania](https://itschool.ro/), part of the [Women4IT](https://women4it.eu/) project, and presented by [Cornel](https://github.com/vladutcornel). 

This GitHub organisation was used to submit homework and projects for code review.
